- Relase version 2.0. All below 
- Add support for viewing threads. This is accomplished by the "t"
  variant (mypst2, pst2, mypst2_quoted etc..)
- Allow a single argument for the myps* variants. The argument is a
  username to filter (default of no argument is still current user)
- Vastly improve performance. Got some good optimizations in here.
  Several times faster than previous versions.
- Draw trees when in thread mdoe, to associate  threads to their parent
  process. "ps auxwwH --forest"  is invalid -- PS can't seem to do this,
  but we can.
- Fix compilation when "bindir" was removed
- Support running Makefile directly.
- Update indentation and include a couple comments
- Update documentation a litttle bit
- A little better structure to make future variants easier
