- Release 7.0 - Remove optional dependency on glib2, 
instead implementing the optimization of uid -> username lookups
inline, using a special method (described in myps2.c).
- Update Makefile, etc to remove any checks for glib, warnings when not found, special cygwin section, etc
- Add -mtune=native to CFLAGS
- Allow specifying a compiler by setting CC env var

* Sep 1 2016 Tim Savannah <kata198@gmail.com>
- Release 6.0 - supporting the "2r" variants (i.e. append "r" after the 2 in
any of the commands). This version attempts to resolve the REAL executable
(not first element of cmdline, aka argv[0]) and replaces it in the output
where possible.

- Fix where a match would not occur in some circumstances if the final character of both search term and cmdline are a match

* Tue Aug 18 2015 Tim Savannah <kata198@gmail.com>
- Remove annoying "myps2 ." crap. myps2 always now goes to current user.
- Add "yourps2 [username] (optional: search args)" for searching the processes filtering by other usernames

- Add cygwin build/install/makefile and default to -D NO_GLIB

* Fri May 8 00:12:00 EDT 2015 Tim Savannah <kata198@gmail.com>
- Add alias to myps2 "other user" argument (first arg) of "." to resolve
to local user. Example "myps2" and "myps2 ." are equivlant.
- Add built-in searching to all of the myps2 and ps2 variants. Each
additional argument that is present specifies an AND filter for that
string to be present.
    
      Examples:
        ps2 gcc myproject # This will return any commandline by any user
                          # which contains both "gcc" and "myproject"
    
        myps2 . firefox   # Show all processes owned by me which contain
                          # "firefox" in the cmdline string

- Relase version 2.0. All below 
- Add support for viewing threads. This is accomplished by the "t"
  variant (mypst2, pst2, mypst2_quoted etc..)
- Allow a single argument for the myps* variants. The argument is a
  username to filter (default of no argument is still current user)
- Vastly improve performance. Got some good optimizations in here.
  Several times faster than previous versions.
- Draw trees when in thread mdoe, to associate  threads to their parent
  process. "ps auxwwH --forest"  is invalid -- PS can't seem to do this,
  but we can.
- Fix compilation when "bindir" was removed
- Support running Makefile directly.
- Update indentation and include a couple comments
- Update documentation a litttle bit
- A little better structure to make future variants easier
