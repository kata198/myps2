Usage: configure (options)

Configure some options for myps2. Not required, only use to cutomize.

  Options:

    --help / -h / -?       -  Print this message

    --no-output-buffer     -  Instead of allocating a large buffer for stdout
                              use default line-by-line (slower, uses less mem)

    --output-buffer-size=N -  Set stdout output buffer size to N bytes.
                              May have \"k\" suffix to indicate kilobytes ( * 1024)
                              Default: 16384 (16K)

    --num-username-buckets=N   -  uid -> username lookups are cached for performance.
                              This value specifies the number of buckets
                              used in these cache lookups, modulus uid.

                              Default is 10 which means one bucket for each
                              last digit of uid. This is a good value for most
                              systems. If you have a TON ( > 40 ) active users,
                              you may want to increase. If you have 1-2 active
                              users, you may want to decrease. Almost always
                              default is best value.

                              Must be > 0. Use 1 to have a single bucket
                              and disable splitting based on uid

    --summon-the-cows         ??????

    --threads-view-flat       On the *pst2* variants (which show threads), the default
                              is to display them \"tree-style\", that is indented from
                              the parent process.

                              If this option is specified, threads and processes
                              will be shown at the same level.

    --threads-view-full       On the *pst2* variants, show threads with same display
                              as a normal process. May still be tree or flat view.


Run with no arguments to restore default settings.
